MERN Practice App.

Server NPM Dependencies to install,
 body-parser
 cors
 express 
 nodemon 
 mongoose

Building from scratch we begin by creating a client side folder where the react app will reside.
Then a server folder for the backend Nodejs/Mongo/express will be. 

Back-end set up
In the server folder we will begin with creating a index.js file. Then use  npm init -y  to create our package.json.
add "type": "module" under "main".

remove "test": underscripts and replace with "start": "nodemon index.js" 
this will allow the server to be updated without restarting during development.

 mongoose
